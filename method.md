## Method
1. In this section. we first introduce the preliminaries of ~ in Sec. ~.
2. The pipeline of our ~ is described in Sec. ~.
3. Then we detail ~
4. Finally, we show ~
5. Suppose we have ~
6. ~ follows the popular ~ framework ~
7. The training paradigm is divided into ~ parts.
8. ~, formulated as: (equation)
9. One of the core problems in ~
10. The ratio $\lambda$ is a scalar that conforms to the ~ distribution.
11. ~ results in clear improvements
12. To narrow(fill) the gap,
13. Fig. ~ illustrates ~
14. ~ is then fed to ~, obtaining the model prediction ~
15. To cover such callenging cases,
16. We verify the effectiveness of our ~
17. The training of ~ consists of ~ parts:
18. Our goal is to ~
19. We start by ~ing ~ in Sec. ~.
20. Our proposed method includes ~ (described in Sec. ~), ~ (in Sec. ~), and ~ (explained in Sec. ~).
