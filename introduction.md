## Introduction
1. ~ at an exponential rate
2. ~ have achieved great successes
3. ~ is time-consuming and labor-intensive
4. ~ is of great importance
5. In this spirit,
6. ~, preventing them from ~
7. Recently, ~ have shown strong results
8. ~ has yet to be fully explored
9. While it sounds appealing to extend ~,
10. As a result, ~ leads to inferior(unsatisfactory) performance
11. model, intitialized with weights from ~
12. ~ demonstrates promising results even when ~
13. in the ~ setting
14. ~ are not perfectly suitable for ~
15. as will be shown empirically, ~
16. In this work, we propose ~, a ~-based ~ method
17. Most importantly, ~
18. Such a design could better model ~
19. ~ only consider simple ~
20. To help the model learn ~, we further introduce ~
21. When combining ~, significant improvements are achieved.
22. As shown in Fig. ~
23. Our contributions are as follows:
24. We are the first to (explore)~
25. We conduct extensive experiments on ~ benchmark datasets.
26. Our method sets a strong baseline for ~
